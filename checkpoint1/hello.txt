Fun Fact: 

Hey! I'm Sukh (Sook), and a fun fact about me is that I make electronic music and is am a serious audiophile! 
Additionally, I work for an applied analytics company that is putting together a SaaS platform that
quantifies government risk for the private sector. I work on Go-To-Market-Strategy and I love listening 
to the technical conversations, but I don't know enough about DS to understand what is happening. 
I hope MDST gives me the baseline technical background to engage with, and contribute to the tecnhical conversations
on a fundamental level!
